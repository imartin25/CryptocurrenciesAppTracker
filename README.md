# Crypto Prices App
This is a React App that allows users to search for cryptocurrency prices. The App consists of an input field where users can enter the name of a cryptocurrency, a search button, and a list of tracked cryptocurrencies. When the user clicks on the search button, the App calls an API and returns the current price of the given cryptocurrency. The user can then delete tracked cryptocurrencies from the list by clicking on the 'X' button.
